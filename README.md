Project 5: Tour Guide App
You will be making your own multi-screen Android app to share your knowledge about a city you are
very familiar with.
The goal is to create a Tour Guide app which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting
your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain
all the best known secrets that only locals know. It’s up to you which categories you want to provide, as
well as what information to provide in each category.
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course.
They include:
● Planning your app design and navigation before coding
● Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
● Building layouts to display those lists of data
● Navigating between lists in Fragments using a ViewPager or Navigation Drawer*
● Creating your own custom classes
● Properly handling images or audio (if applicable)
